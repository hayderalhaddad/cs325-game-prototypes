<h2>Your game title</h2>
Get the chicks!
<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game is very short, and aims to frustrate players in a fun way as they try to finish it. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I created my own tile map using "Tiled" application
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to update sprite texture as the player progresses through the game, and using physics on sprites. 
I also learned how to create my own tilemaps, add text, and create an intro screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Chick sprite image: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/photonstorm/phaser-examples/master/examples/assets/sprites/chick.png">Chick</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I borrowed the template-tilemap code and modified it. 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Find and collect your baby chicks as fast as you can!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Chicken 
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<ul>

<li>State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.</li>
<li>Input: mouse. Randomness: Both determanistic and random.</li>
<li> Playstyle: Joker. 
<li> Genre: racing

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game is exploring high accelartion and velocity, and its affect on the difficulty of collision.

</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should find the game funny since it will be frustrating to win it. Players will also feel excited once they have actually won the game.  
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
 The player is a chick avaatar that they will move around to try and find and collect its baby chicks which are placed randomly in the map. The player's avaatar will follow the mouse pointer and accelerates 
 towards it. While moving at very high speeds, the player will navigate through the tilemap to find its baby chicks. When a chick is found, the player's avaatar has to collide with the chick in order to collect it. Since the accelartion and max speed are very high, the player will be challenged to collide with the target quickly. Once all chicks are collected, the game ends, and the player is shown how much time it took him to finish the game.  
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The player can  try and decrease his speed by constatly accelarting in opposite directions which will help him gain control over his avaatar
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A group of students who are trying to have a quick break and laugh while they attempt to win. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Around 30 - 60 seconds. 
</li>
