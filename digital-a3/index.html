<h2>Your game title</h2>
Get the chicks!
<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game gets harder without changing levels or scenes!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
	The game uses multiple timers to control sprite groups
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learend how to use groups to add multiple sprites. The challenging part was getting rid of sprites that no longer exist, and freeing up some resources. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Portal sprite image: <a href="http://technicpack.wikia.com/wiki/File:Portal.png">Portal</a></li>

</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>

	The player is a star avaatar that is trying to get to the portal without dying. There are waves of astroids going down on the player. The player needs to avoid getting hit. The portal is found in the center of the map, so the player needs to move up towards it. To be able to do that, the player needs to collect the yellow star which will allow them to advance. As the player moves up, it will be more challenging to avoid getting hit.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>

The player should only collect yellow stars when its not surrounded by enemies. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
As stargazers love stars, they now need to save one. The only way to travel through the universe is through portals!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone can play this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
